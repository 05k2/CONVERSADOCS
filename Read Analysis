In the Conversadocs project, the results and output serve as the culmination of the user's interaction with the application, providing them with valuable insights and information based on their queries and interactions. When a user submits a query or asks a question through the application interface, the conversational AI model processes the input and generates a response.
 This response is formulated based on the context provided by the uploaded documents, utilizing natural language processing techniques to understand the user's intent and generate human-like responses that effectively address the user's queries. Once the response is generated, it is presented to the user through the application's interface in a clear and user-friendly manner.
 The presentation of content is designed to be intuitive and accessible, allowing users to easily understand and interact with the information provided by the application.
